    <p class="h">Last year, I was planning to give someone a gift for Sekur's birthday. I was already going to give it but they suddenly said that they don't accept gifts. I felt devastated the following months after, because this never happened to me before. I gave gifts to Cindir, Setor, Nonter, Setum, but how come Sekur didn't accept my gift? It was really that we didn't know about each other's attitudes, but I treated it as efforts wasted.</p>
    <p class="h">That one event started my spiral of descent to chaos as I started treating everyone around me as people who have even the slightest grudge on me. I lost the inspiration to do schoolwork, and let luck decide my fate for the next few months. My emotions would vary throughout the day. I was crying and breaking down almost every week in school, but at times I'd be the noisiest and most energetic person in class. At the very least, my classmates were confused as to how I felt, but they couldn't do anything. I treated it as them not wanting to help me and marking myself as a loner, even though I have a reliable support system of friends that I can run to. Huci, Nuto, Besper, Chadar, the list is endless, but even then, my mind constantly told me "you're a loner, Aggnuch." I was enslaved by my mind's perception of life, but that drastically changed when the Coronavirus pandemic happened.</p>
    <p class="h">Make no mistake, we all had bad times during the various community quarantines, and that I am privileged enough to write about my happy experiences, and so I'll try to write in a way that is sensitive to those who had it worse than me. Also, having written what I'm about to say, I will use these new experiences to help not only myself, but others during these trying times.</p>
    <p class="h">During the early days of the pandemic, I was initially terrified of how Corona would play out for me. Thankfully, I came out with a healthier mindset and disposition, and I could process my emotions better than last time. I disregarded my inner grudge against Sekur, but to this day I don't have the courage to apologize. That time will soon come. I also took the time to connect with some of my friends during quarantine, and tried to restore the positive, optimistic individual I was in my early days. Over the months, I felt better and more confident of myself, and some of my greatest friends noticed that I'm slowly changing back to my energetic attitude. Everyday I was trying to improve myself and make the best out of every day.</p>
    <p class="h">It was now the first day of school. I had mixed emotions after my earth science class; I had a sense of hope that I can be more productive during the school year, but on the contrary, I also felt frustrated as I am attending online classes without a laptop: something that I estimate 85% of the class has.</p>
    <p class="h">I have this favorite YouTuber (let's call him Josh) who I have been watching for the past few months, and that night, I decided to rewatch his proposal video to his then-girlfriend (let's call her Gab). I've watched the whole thing several times now, but I felt as if I only watched it for the first time. I had a rush of feelings and excitement for the two, even though the video was uploaded 5 years ago! Out of curiosity, I decided to search marriage proposal videos on YouTube, and I was hooked for an hour on end.</p>
    <p class="h">One of the proposal videos I watched was a Japanese man proposing to his girlfriend through a flash mob. Two men walk to this open area outside a restaurant in Osaka, and they do a freezing pose, capturing the crowd's attention. Charice's song, Louder, started playing and a woman started dancing around the two men. They "come alive", and by the time the first chorus ended, a few more people joined them, including two waiters from the restaurant. The second verse came in with customers and schoolgirls showing themselves dancing in front of the crowd. As the second chorus started, a duo shows up, performing what seems to be gymnastic moves. The flash mob reappears, and as the bridge started, another man "walked up to a woman and asked her to dance with him". The woman was kind of hesitant to join the mob who was facing her.</p>
    <p class="h">But then, the star of the show enters. As the second to the last chorus played, a man wearing pink comes to the front of the crowd and performs cheoreographed dance moves in front of his girlfriend. She was surprised at first! As the chorus ended, the mob approached her for two purposes; they wanted to invite her to the flash mob and the waiters were setting up a carpet for the man to walk on. They then handed him a bouquet of flowers for him to give to the woman. The mob then brought her to one end of the carpet. Everyone then aligned along the carpet, throwing flower petals on it. The man walked up to the aisle from the other side and gave her the flowers. He said a short message to the woman, then brought out his proposal ring. She said yes! Everyone around them cheered and a joyful atmosphere reigned everywhere.</p>
    <p class="h">After having watched this video, I was totally pumped up out of inspiration. I couldn't even start to fathom how much effort everybody had to exert just for such a proposal to happen so smoothly. And the fact that the man would trek mountains just for his girlfriend amazes me until now. Looking at Josh's proposal to Gab and the Japanese man's proposal to his girlfriend, I started having a chain of daydreams related to it.</p>
    <p class="h">In ten years, let's face it, I will have a relationship with someone, and I really really want to show them how many miles I would walk just to show my undying love for them. How will I go about planning a proposal? Will it be simple or grand? Regardless, the point of these proposals was that it triggered my will to exert 1000% effort on everything I do everyday. I am energetic, talented, skillful, smart, loud, passionate, you name everything. I want to show the world how effortful I am on something I do great in. Which is why the song Louder by Charice resonated with me for a long time. Not only does it have an energetic feel to it for me, but also I have formed a positive relationship with the song by tying it to that marriage proposal video which is tied to my will to do extraordinary things just like what the man did for his girl. Whenever I hear the song, I sometimes can't help but to get up and dance to the beat and imagine all the great things I can do for myself.</p>
    <p class="h">It's high time I move on from thinking that my efforts always go wasted. I did wonders before, and I always shone. I had untapped potential in myself that I could use. I was a flightless crow, but I know I can soar to greater heights. Nothing will ever stop my heart from shouting that I can do whatever I want. But with everything I plan to do, I must be careful.</p>
