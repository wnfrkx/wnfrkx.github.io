	<h1>My UPMC Sigsheet Level</h1>
	<p>Are you an applicant wanting to keep track of your sigsheet progress? Or a member trying to remember who you interacted with in UPMC? Julgat has the right tool for you.</p>
	<p>This project takes huge inspiration from My Philippines Travel level by Denz here: <a href="https://my-philippines-travel-level.com/">https://my-philippines-travel-level.com/</a></p>
	<h1>How to use</h1>
	<p>If you are a member, you may refer to our sigsheet tracker to determine who is who in the sigsheet.</p>
	<p>If you are an applicant, this is a great way to visualize your progress in the sigsheet!</p>
	<p>This self-made map is divided into eight "islands" representing the Executive Committee, the six standing committees and the members on leave as reflected in the 22B sigsheet. Clicking on a "province" in the map will reveal a member's codename and a few phrases.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Signature obtained</b> - You got the member's signature during your application process.</li>
		<li><b>Task accomplished</b> - You accomplished that member's task and you are awaiting their signature.</li>
		<li><b>Basic information known</b> - You collected the basic information needed for that member's place in the sigsheet.</li>
		<li><b>Interactions made</b> - You interacted with the member at least once but you never interviewed them for their signature.</li>
		<li><b>Social media mutuals</b> - You and the member are social media mutuals. That's it.</li>
		<li><b>Never interacted with</b> - You never interacted with this member yet..</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Your "sigsheet level" will update in real-time. Plus, your progress in the map will not be erased! This means that, even if you leave this page, you can always come back to this page.</p>
